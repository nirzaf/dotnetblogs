# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog built with Next.js and MDX! This is a sample post to demonstrate the capabilities of this blogging platform.

## Why Next.js and MDX?

Next.js provides an excellent framework for building static and server-rendered React applications. Combined with MDX, it allows for a powerful authoring experience where you can embed React components directly in your Markdown content.

### Features of this blog

- **Fast Performance**: Static site generation for blazing fast page loads
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Easy on the eyes at night
- **MDX Support**: Write JSX directly in your Markdown
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Great for technical posts

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

## Custom Components

MDX allows you to use custom components in your markdown. For example, here's a Tweet component:

<Tweet id="1234567890" />

And here's a YouTube video:

<YouTubeVideo id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

## What's Next?

In the coming weeks, I'll be sharing more about:

1. Web development best practices
2. React and Next.js tips and tricks
3. UI/UX design principles
4. Performance optimization techniques

Stay tuned for more content!

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out my blog. Feel free to explore more posts and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
